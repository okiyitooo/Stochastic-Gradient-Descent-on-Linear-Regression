# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-on-Linear-Regression
# SDGRegressor to Predict Crowdness at the Gym

 I decided to build a predictive model using Machine Learninhg, especifically a linear regressor using Stochastic Gradient Decsent.

Using a dataset with over 60,000 observations and 11 featres including day, hour, temperature and other details, I will be creating a model that can predict how many people will be at the gym at a particular day and time. 

# Import Libraries and Load the Data
The first step, is loading the libraries I will need to use to load and explore the data. I will be using the following ones:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Also note I am using the magic inline command to plot graphs directly on to the notebook.
